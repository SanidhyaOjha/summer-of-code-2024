# Week 1

- was used to Coursera Notebooks so this was first encounter on data handling and preprocessing
- got a good idea of how to prepare data before model training
- my **approach** was to follow each step and lookout for the articles on how to those processes 
- then try to use every feature of the functions using and exploring about its uses
- some other learnings were about practical implemntation of grid search

## Challanges
- implementation of undersampling was challeneging as I encountered several errors but those were eaasily tackled as there were some discrepancies in code convention
- shap implementation was difficult to understand although precision recall was easier to grasp

## results
- the training data gives 99.29 % accuracy
- the test data (20% of resampled data) gives accuracy of 98.6%
- the variance is suitable enough
